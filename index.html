	<p> 
		So, we’ll go no more a-roving
		<br><br><br><br>So late into the night,
		Though the heart be still as loving,
		<br><br><br><br>And the moon be still as bright.
		For the sword outwears its sheath,
		<br><br><br><br>And the soul wears out the breast,
		And the heart must pause to breathe,
		<br><br><br><br>And love itself have rest.
		Though the night was made for loving,
		<br><br><br><br>And the day returns too soon,
		Yet we’ll go no more a-roving
		<br><br><br><br>By the light of the moon.
